# NETD
NETD (Dynamic Non-I.I.D. Encrypted Traffic Dataset), a dataset designed to support research on Out-of-Distribution (O.O.D.) generalization for encrypted traffic classification. NETD is constructed by introducing controlled distributional shifts into existing public datasets, allowing researchers to evaluate model robustness under varying conditions
